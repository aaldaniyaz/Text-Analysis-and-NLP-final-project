TwoXChromosomes,My dog protected me today.,"I live in a city with my 9 month old golden retriever puppy [(puppy tax)](https://imgur.com/a/alWT6y8). He's the sweetest boy and loves every dog and person he sees on the street and in the park.  

I was walking back from the dog park with my happy puppy and an older man on a bike yelled across the street that he was cute, I laughed and said thank you. Par for the course with my dog - I'm sure you can see why. The man then took this as an invitation to bicycle over to me, and stop right next to me.  

He began to ask me questions and the encounter went from pleasant to irritating. ""How old are you, are you in school? What's your puppy's name?""  

I told him my boyfriend was in med school and waiting for me (he is actually out of the country, so not true), and to have a nice day, and he proceeded to go ""mannnnnnn...everyone has a boyfriend..."" and bicycle next to me down the path back to my apartment, as I was clearly walking away from him and he had been going the other way.  

My pup then turns to him and starts snarling, and barking, an absolute first for him. His hackles are raised, and he starts jumping towards the man on his bike a bit. The creep gets all nervous, saying stuff like ""woah, woah woah, why are you acting like this puppy?"" and finally stops cycling and lets me walk back alone. Of course, he still yelled out ""WANNA FUCK?"" across the parking lot.

MensLib,The Mandalorian the kind of positive portrayal of masculinity we need more of [Spoilers],"Just finished watching the first season of Mandalorian last night, and wow what a show. As a Star Wars fan since childhood I absolutely loved it. I wanted to break down some things I loved most. Spoiler Alert for those who haven't seen the whole season and want to go in totally blind!

But the thing that struck me most is what a positive portrayal of masculinity the main character specifically is. I think there were 5 things that stood out to me most clearly:

**1.) Men can and should be seen as caregivers**

This is the most obvious one. The whole season revolves around him finding Baby Yoda, building a connection with Baby Yoda, and ultimately culminating with Baby Yoda essentially being his child. How many TV shows are out there showing men who are incompetent at caregiving, or even actively run from it? Giving care is seen as a ""burden""

Mando has an internal struggle sure, but he never treats Baby Yoda poorly, and in fact instead of running from caregiving, he turns to it. He embraces it.

**2.) Conflicts can and should be solved without violence whenever possible.**

There's often a call in video games to have more problems able to be solved without violence. Mandalorian provides a great blueprint for how this can be achieved. He's an incredibly powerful and skilled fighter, and he could very easily end almost any conflict with violence. There are multiple situations where he opts for negotiation, trade, and other means to end his conflicts. He also clearly doesn't kill when it's unnecessary. That he didn't actually kill any of those who betrayed him in the jailbreak episode is proof of that.

Now - does he still have learning to do? Absolutely... the Jawa situation earlier is a good example of that. But he clearly uses his brain and his social understanding to know when to not use violence. This is huge when compared to so many fantasy/sci fi heroes just smashing everything and asking questions later.

**3.)** **Men can and should treat all women as equals, and need not feel threatened by powerful/strong(not just physically) women. In fact, powerful women can help men achieve even more than they could alone.**

Mando understands this so clearly. At no point does he show intimidation, fear, or resentment of Cara. He in fact seeks her help multiple times. He also seeks help (and clear mentorship) from the woman making his armor, he seeks caregiving help from the woman who fixed his ship on Tattoine.  

Women can be tech experts, fighters, mentors, and more. This fact does not threaten Mandos masculinity in the slightest. In fact, it's just treated as obvious... just like seeking help from them is the smartest and best thing to do. Mando knows when to be deferential, and when to take the lead. There are some great business teamwork lessons here haha.

This is a fantastic portrayal of how men should operate in a world with so many powerful, competent women who can actually enrich their lives.

4.) **Strength (of all kinds) and Honor are can and should be part of positive masculinity, and much better than out-dated notions of ""chivalry""** 

Too often we see heroes in our stories presenting out dated notions of chivalry. They have to save the damsel in distress, they are arrogant, violent, etc. The toxicity of chivalry can die in a fire.... and a show like The Mandalorian helps stoke the flames. 

Mando consistently shows two things associated with ""knights"" or heroes... strength, and honor. But he eschews the negative elements of both.

Strength isn't just physical strength for Mando... he has strength in his convictions, stength in his ability to bear the weight of his emotional scares, strength of mind for solving problems. Strength to do what must be done when outcomes are uncertain. This is positive masculinity. 

Honor is the big one for me. Not stabbing someone in the back, not lying, cheating, hurting innocents, adhering to a positive value system. Mando does this in spades. And when he falls short, the story shows him learning more (see: his views on droids). 

**5. ) Empathy and emotion are wonderful, and having both makes you a stronger man.** 

This is where Mando had the most growth this season, and will continue to grow. Mandalorian's are a stoic people. Bounty Hunters are unempathetic. Mando absolutely hated droids.

But by the end... we hear Mando's voice break. We see him express concern for his companions, and especially baby Yoda. We see him have empathy for a droid reprogrammed from a merciless killer to a caregiver. 

Mando is a stronger character and man at the end of the season than he was at the beginning. This show displays his growth expertly, and of course leaves room for him to continue to grow. 

&#x200B;

Overall, I couldn't be happier with what I saw out of the Mandalorian, and I hope that creative folks continue to tell stories that feature men like this. 

Masculinity is not inherently toxic, in fact, men can be strong, honorable, deferential, emotional, empathetic, and more.... all while being total badasses.

TwoXChromosomes,I'm so proud of my fianc√© and I want to share this little story with you,"Today we were babysitting two of our nieces( 4 and 6 years old). They start screaming in the room where they were playing while my fianc√© and I cooked lunch. 

We immediately ran into the room to see what happened and there was a small hairy scorpion that somehow got into the house. It's good they screamed because these things are nasty little demons. 

So my fianc√© runs and picks up the scorpion before it has a chance to scurry away.

Now what makes this worth posting: as my fianc√© was getting the scorpion, the oldest niece said that it was good that he was there because ""girls can't deal with that stuff.""

So my fianc√©  (hereafter referred to as Alex [I'm a liar. I'll never call him Alex again]), immediately asks her who told her that. She shrugged her shoulders and said that everyone knows girls can't deal with bugs and snakes (this is arizona, btw)

So he calls her over and tells her that girls are just as good as boys and that she should never think she can't do something because she's a girl. 

She said that she thought girls were ""supposed to be scared of bugs"". He told her, ""You never have to be afraid of something because youre a girl. You just have to be smart. Like when you saw this scorpion and you called me and your aunt in here. That was very smart of you and im proud of you for letting adults know about something that was a danger to you. You recognized there was something that could hurt you, and you got help. You are every bit as smart and strong and capable as any boy out there.""

He held the scorpions tail  with his fingers and held it in the palm of his hand. She started to look more and more confident and brave as she stood there with him. 

 He  explained to her that as she grows up people are always going to try to tell her what she can and cannot do, but that she can do anything if she puts her heart and mind into it. He told her there are women that work with bugs for their jobs and study them. She got so excited at the thought of a woman being able to do things a man can do. 

At this point her little sister has worked her way over to look at it too. So he sits there and explains the different parts of it and what they're for. Completely captured their imaginations.

The oldest girl asked if she could hold it. So he put it on her hands while he held the pinches and the tail and she held the scorpion in her hands. She was so proud of herself she talked about it until she went to sleep. 

I'm pregnant so it just makes me proud that our daughter, if we have a girl, will grow up with a father that believes in her.

Now what makes this worth posting: as my fianc√© was getting the scorpion, the oldest niece said that it was good that he was there because ""girls can't deal with that stuff.""

So my fianc√©  (hereafter referred to as Alex [I'm a liar. I'll never call him Alex again]), immediately asks her who told her that. She shrugged her shoulders and said that everyone knows girls can't deal with bugs and snakes (this is arizona, btw)

So he calls her over and tells her that girls are just as good as boys and that she should never think she can't do something because she's a girl. 

She said that she thought girls were ""supposed to be scared of bugs"". He told her, ""You never have to be afraid of something because youre a girl. You just have to be smart. Like when you saw this scorpion and you called me and your aunt in here. That was very smart of you and im proud of you for letting adults know about something that was a danger to you. You recognized there was something that could hurt you, and you got help. You are every bit as smart and strong and capable as any boy out there.""

He held the scorpions tail  with his fingers and held it in the palm of his hand. She started to look more and more confident and brave as she stood there with him. 

 He  explained to her that as she grows up people are always going to try to tell her what she can and cannot do, but that she can do anything if she puts her heart and mind into it. He told her there are women that work with bugs for their jobs and study them. She got so excited at the thought of a woman being able to do things a man can do. 

At this point her little sister has worked her way over to look at it too. So he sits there and explains the different parts of it and what they're for. Completely captured their imaginations.

The oldest girl asked if she could hold it. So he put it on her hands while he held the pinches and the tail and she held the scorpion in her hands. She was so proud of herself she talked about it until she went to sleep. 

I'm pregnant so it just makes me proud that our daughter, if we have a girl, will grow up with a father that believes in her.
